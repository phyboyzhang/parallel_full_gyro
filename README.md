# parallel_full_gyro
This is a particle-in-cell code to compare full kinetic and gyrokinetic  simulation with hybrid parallel scheme

1. Only the electrostatic potential is considered in current version of thsi code.

2. Since the perpendicular drift of charged particles magnetized in the magnetic field is the focus of gyrokinetic theory,
the simulation domain is confined within the perpendicular surface to the magnetic field, and the parallel dimension is 
not included. 

3. linked list is used to store the
